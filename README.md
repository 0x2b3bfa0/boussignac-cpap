# Georges CPAP
3D printable CPAP system with no moving parts. This system could pose the following advantages over traditional solutions:

> #### Lowest O2 consumption rate of any CPAP system
> * Only 15-30L/min flow rate for 3.5-10cmH2O
>
> #### System doesn't require a flow generator
> * Eliminates investment in capital equipment and repair
> * Only needs O2 source and flowmeter
>
> #### Only completely open CPAP system
> * Eliminates re-breathing
> * Reduces risk of barotrauma
> * Decreases the work of breathing
> * Accomodates patient's high peak inspiratory flow demand
> * Allows use of suction catheter or bronchoscope without loss of CPAP
>
> #### Only CPAP system that depends entirely on the O2 flow rate
> * CPAP easily adjusts to patient's need (2.5-20cmH2O) simply by titrating O2 flow
> * PEEP adjustable by changing flow rate, no valves to change
> * Constant, accurate pressure measurement via optional manometer
> 
> #### Complete, easy to use, portable, single use system
> * CPAP set up in <2 minutes, therefore ideal for all EMS and ED settings
> * Requires 75% less space in field packs than competitive systems
> * Weighs only 10 grams, 2" long
> * Permits CPAP without interruption during transport
