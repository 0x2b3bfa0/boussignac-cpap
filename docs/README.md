DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE. These designs and documents are for experimental purposes ONLY and no warranty as to fitness or function is provided. The pressures created by this device are DANGEROUS and can cause barotrauma (i.e. lungs go POP, you go PLOP).
```

This fully printable device with no moving parts is able to provide a continuous positive pressure to a patient's airways while letting them breathe freely.

## About the device
This design provides a 3d-printable CPAP mask that can be manufactured in areas without access to standard CPAP or BiPAP equipment that has been shown to be desireable in COVID-19 patients [(source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261654/).

This device is not suitable for mass-manufacture, entities with the resources and logistics necessary should purchase either commercial electronic BiPAP or CPAP machines, or the Boussignac CPAP produced by [VYGON](https://www.vygon.com/).

The design is parametric, so you may desire to tune the values to achieve different goals. The main parameter that users will want to tune is 'patient channel diameter', but the 'egress' parameter may also be tuned to account for differences in SLA exposure, resins, and finishing processes.
