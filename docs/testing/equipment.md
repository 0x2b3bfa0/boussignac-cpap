# Equipment

In order to verify the successful manufacture of the valve, the following equipment will be needed:

## Air Supply

Air compressor with regulator, should be able to provide 15L/min @ 40 PSI

## Flow limiter

Pressure compensated, should be able to limit to 15L/min to match standard medical equipment. Can be approximated with an 0.8mm printer nozzle @ 35 PSI. [Calculator for airflow](https://www.tlv.com/global/TI/calculator/air-flow-rate-through-orifice.html)

## Manometer

A manometer that can accurately show pressures in the 0-20cm H2O range is vital. A U-tube manometer is easily constructed out of clear vinyl tubing.
